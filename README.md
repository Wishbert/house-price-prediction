# Median House Value Estimator
Median House Value Estimation in python.

In this project I use a few regressor algorithms to estimate the median value of a house in a district.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
* python 3.8.8

    * This setup requires that your machine has python 3.8 installed on it. you can refer to this url https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download python. Once you have python downloaded and installed, you will need to setup PATH variables (if you want to run python program directly, detail instructions are below in how to run software section). To do that check [this](https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/).

   * Setting up PATH variable is optional as you can also run program without it and more instruction are given below on this topic.

    * Then you should run: `pip install requirements.txt`

* Second and easier option is to download anaconda and use its anaconda prompt to run the commands. To install anaconda check this url https://www.anaconda.com/download/.
